# Funkin-0.2.8.0-Port

After waiting a few days for Friday Night Funkin' 0.2.8.0 (where week 7 appeared) on PC, I decided to make a port of this version on PC before it was officially done. I used KadeEngine as a basis, textures and other content I downloaded directly from Newgrounds servers.

P.S. - since I'm Russian, I used google translator so don't pay attention to mistakes :)
